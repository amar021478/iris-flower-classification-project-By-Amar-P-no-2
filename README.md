Iris Flower Classification Project
Project Description
The Iris Flower Classification Project is a machine learning project designed to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their sepals and petals. This classic dataset is often used as an introduction to machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
There are three classes of iris plants:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Objective
The main objective of this project is to build and train a machine learning model that can predict the species of iris flowers based on the provided measurements.

Steps Involved
Data Loading: Load the iris dataset from a standard repository or source.

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, attributes, and distributions. Visualize relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for model training by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features if necessary.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines).

Model Training: Train the selected models using the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the selected model by tuning hyperparameters to improve its performance.

Prediction: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.

Deployment: If applicable, deploy the model to a production environment for inference.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
Scikit-learn: Library used for machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment for data analysis and experimentation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization.
